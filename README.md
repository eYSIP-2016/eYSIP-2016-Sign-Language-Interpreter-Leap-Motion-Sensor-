# Sign Language Interpretation And Robotic Hand With Natural Control System

Sign Language Interpretation project is to help hearing-impaired and verbally challenged people to communicate with other people. This system will try to interpret the sign language into natural voice. so other people can understand what they want to say. And the robotic hand is just for application of leap motion sensor and galileo board.



This project uses the following components:

* **Leap Motion Sensor**

* **Galileo board**

* **MP3 Module**

* **Communication Protocol:** WebSocket, UART

* **InMoov Robotic Hand**

* **Servo Motors**



##Description:

***

Sign Language Interpretation system made for converting sign language to audio. After recognizing words, the system will make the whole sentence using NLTK and play pre-recorded files from MP3 module. In another part,whatever a person will perform on leap motion sensor, the robotic hand will replicate that pose.







##Features:

***

**Sign Language Interpretation:**

- Recognizing gestures with high accuracy.

- Conversion of a set of words to a natural sentence.

**Robotic Hand With Natural Control System**

- Easy to assemble design

- Easy to control with your hand



##Key Tasks

***

* Recognizing alphabet through sign

* Recognizing words with gestures

* Creating natural sentence from set of words (Using NLTK)

* Interfacing MP3 module with Galileo Board.

* Driving Servo with Galileo Board

* Assembling Robotic Hand.

* Mapping hand movement with servo angle





##Deliverables

***

* Sign Language Interpretation System

* Robotic Hand

* Code and Documentation

* Tutorials and report



##Documentation

***

* Detailed tutorials for every module of the project have been uploaded on GitHub.
