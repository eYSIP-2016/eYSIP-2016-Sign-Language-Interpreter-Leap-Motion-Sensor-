\section{Task Accomplished}
\begin{frame}{Task Accomplished}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Task 1 (Get familiar with sensor and board)
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item In this task Linux was installed on Galileo board and run some basic programme on board.
		    \item Seen stuff in Leap Motion Control Panel and see applications there.
		    \item Search about how to develop with Leap Motion Sensor and found Leap SDK.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Task 2 (Generation of data for different hands and fingers)
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item In this task I have studied about Leap SDK and it's Library 
		    \item And make simple programme for displaying  data related position and direction of hands and fingers
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Task Accomplished}
\begin{frame}{Task Accomplished}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Task 3 (Individual alphabet recognize)
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item In this task one programme is made in which we need to first load pose with one alphabet and then we can recognize that alphabet by performing that pose
		\end{itemize}
		\item Task 4 (Record gesture for words)
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item Here one interface is used for recording and recognizing gesture for particular word or sentence.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Task 5 (Communication between Leap and Galileo Board)
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item Here Websocket on localnetwork is used to transmit data between Leap and Galileo. 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges Faced}
\begin{frame}{Challenges Faced}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recording and Recognizing Gestures in Leap motion Sensor
		\item Installing Windows IOT on Galileo
		\item Making sentence from basic words generated from system
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future Plans}
\begin{frame}{Future Plans}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Interfacing with MP3 module is remaining in my task
		\item Making sentence generation more reliable
		\item Load more words and make system more accurate..
		\item Making robotics hand which will be operated by moving our hand.
